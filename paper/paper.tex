\newcommand{\hbmm}{handle-based memory management~}

\begin{abstract}
Prior to hardware virtual memory multitasking operating systems placed all
programs in the same address space, potentially leading to significant memory
fragmentation. To solve this problem, many systems turned to handles: a level
of abstraction on top of pointers which allow the operating system to
relocate memory without invalidating a program's pointers. To use handles,
programmers were required to manually ``Lock'' and ``Unlock'' these pointers
to allow the operating system relocate and defragment memory without the
worry of corrupting the program. Unfortunately, this led to many of the same
bugs found in manual memory management such as stale references or memory
leaks.

In this paper, we present Alaska - a compiler and run-time system which allows
programmers to use handle-based memory management on unmanaged languages
without changes to the source code. Using modern compiler techniques to
insert the lock and unlock run-time calls, applications can transparently
utilize features like defragmentation, compression, and copy-and-update
semantics -- effectively allowing virtual memory to operate at the
granularity of individual allocations. We show that Alaska does all this with
minimal overhead to applications which don't use handles, but provides a
great deal of control to programs that do.
