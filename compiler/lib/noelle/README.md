This code is taken from the NOELLE codebase: https://github.com/arcana-lab/noelle

Noelle offers a huge number of abstractions to make working with LLVM much easier, but using it in it's entirety would require me to update it to LLVM 15 (from LLVM ~9.0.1). Instead, I'll be outlining certain functionality as I need them, and maybe it'll be updated :)
