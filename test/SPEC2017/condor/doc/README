This condor files and scripts are designed to run the parallelization implemented in NOELLE from the bitcode of the benchamrks generated by the clang front-end.

To run NOELLE, follow the next steps:

1- go to the benchmark repository directory 
  (from here: cd ../../)

2- run "make bitcode_copy". 
   This step copy the bitcode coming out of the front-end to the "benchmarks" directories 

3- go to the condor directory of the benchmark suite:
  (from here: cd ../ )

4- run "make clean ; make optimize.con"
  This step generate a condor file with one job per benchmark. This job will take the baseline bitcode (the one generated in step 2) and replace it with the parallelized bitcode (this is generated by NOELLE).

5- run "make submit".
  This submit the jobs that parallelize the bitcodes

6- wait the jobs to end

7- go to the condor directory
  (from here: cd ../ )

8- run "make clean ; make binary.con ; make submit"
  This step generates the parallel binaries from the parallelized bitcodes

9- wait the jobs to end

10- go to the condor directory
  (from here: cd ../ )

11- run "make clean ; make run.con ; make submit"
  This step runs 5 times each binary generated

12- wait the jobs to end

13- collect all results, execution times, bitcode files, binaries
  - Go to the benchmark suite directory of this repository
    (from here: cd ../../)

  - Run 
    ./scripts/collect_output.sh DIRECTORY_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_EVERYTHING_GENERATED
